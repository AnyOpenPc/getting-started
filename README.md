Making changes quickly
Filling up limitless space
I'm getting these assignments in late. I talked with Danil about taking the second half of the class so that I might take another the first half. On his recommendation I'm here for both and couldn't be more excited. However, this means that through shopping and into post-shopping I was still thinking I might negotiate both classes. What this amounts to is that these first couple of assignments will be a bit tardy. 

Looking forward to sending you all rad work.
